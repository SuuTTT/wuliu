    "\n",
    "#### Overview:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm tackles the problem of optimally allocating a specific type of product from various warehouses to multiple orders. The objective is to minimize the maximum transportation time using Integer Linear Programming (ILP).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "#### Mathematical Formulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ X $: Transport time matrix of size $ n \\times m $, where $ X_{i,j} $ is the time taken to transport the product from warehouse $ j $ to order $ i $.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- $ Y $: Demand vector of size $ n $, where $ Y_i $ is the demand for order $ i $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ Z $: Inventory vector of size $ m $, where $ Z_j $ denotes the available stock in warehouse $ j $.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ A $: Allocation matrix of size $ n \\times m $, where $ A_{i,j} $ is the volume of product allocated from warehouse $ j $ to order $ i $. This is our primary decision variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $ M $: A scalar variable representing the maximum transportation time among all allocations. \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Function**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\min M $$\n",
    "   \n",
    "The primary objective is to minimize $ M $, which captures the maximum transportation time in the entire allocation matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Constraints**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Max Transport Time Constraint**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "$$ M \\geq X_{i,j} \\times A_{i,j} \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}, j \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\} $$\n",
    "    \n",
    "For every combination of order $ i $ and warehouse $ j $, this constraint ensures that $ M $ is always greater than or equal to the product of the transport time and the allocated volume.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Order Demand Constraint**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{j=1}^{m} A_{i,j} = Y_i \\quad \\forall i \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the total allocation for each order matches its demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Warehouse Inventory Constraint**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\sum_{i=1}^{n} A_{i,j} \\leq Z_j \\quad \\forall j \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,m\\} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees that allocations from each warehouse do not exceed its inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Algorithm Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Input Validation\n",
    "- Verify the inputs (Transport Time Matrix $X$, Demand Array $Y$, Stock Array $Z$) to ensure they are valid and consistent with each other in terms of dimensions and values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Initialize Allocation Matrix (A)\n",
    "- Create an empty matrix $A$ with the same dimensions as the Transport Time Matrix $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Calculate Initial Allocation\n",
    "- Distribute products according to an initial algorithm, perhaps starting with the shortest transport times first, while adhering to the constraints.\n",
    "  \n",
    "### Step 4: Optimize for Minimum Maximum Transport Time\n",
    "- Use an optimization algorithm (such as Linear Programming or other optimization techniques) to adjust the initial allocation in $A$. The objective is to minimize the maximum transportation time, which is calculated by the Hadamard product of $A$ and $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5: Validate Final Allocation\n",
    "- Ensure that the final allocation $A$ satisfies all constraints:\n",
    "  1. Sum of allocations for each order $i$ should be equal to $Y_i$.\n",
    "  2. Sum of allocations for each warehouse $j$ should not exceed $Z_j$.\n",
    "  3. All elements in $A$ should be greater than or equal to 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6: Calculate Minimized Maximum Transport Time\n",
    "- Calculate the minimized maximum transport time as per the final $A$ and $X$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 7: Output\n",
    "- Return the Allocation Matrix $A$ and the minimized maximum transport time as the outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "After laying out these steps, the next phases would involve implementing the code, followed by testing with sample data to validate that the algorithm is functioning as expected.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Conclusion: \n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO**: need update, on how outer system call this API, specifically, it call this algo for diff product.\n",
    "\n",
    "By using this algorithm, supply chain managers can make informed decisions about product allocation, optimizing transportation time, and ensuring timely deliveries. The mathematical formulation provides clarity on the constraints and objectives, making the approach more transparent and understandable."

    "### Complexity Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "To analyze the complexity of your Linear Programming (LP) formulation for the allocation problem, consider the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Variable Initialization**: The decision variable matrix \\(A\\) has \\(m \\times n\\) elements. Plus, there's one extra variable \\(M\\). Thus, initialization is \\(O(m \\times n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Objective Function**: You're only setting \\(M\\) as the objective, which is \\(O(1)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Constraints**: \n",
    "   - The constraint \\(M \\geq X[i][j] \\times A_{ij}\\) runs in \\(O(m \\times n)\\).\n",
    "   - The constraint for the sum of allocations for each order is \\(O(m \\times n)\\) because there are \\(n\\) orders and each sum goes through \\(m\\) elements.\n",
    "   - The constraint for the sum of allocations from each warehouse is also \\(O(m \\times n)\\) because there are \\(m\\) warehouses and each sum goes through \\(n\\) elements.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Overall, the constraints add up to \\(O(m \\times n) + O(m \\times n) + O(m \\times n) = O(m \\times n)\\).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Solving the LP**: The complexity of solving an integer linear programming (ILP) problem is, in general, NP-hard. However, given that you are using the PuLP solver, it's likely using simplex or a similar efficient algorithm for linear relaxations and then branching methods for the integer constraints. It's tough to pin down an exact complexity for this part due to a variety of factors (e.g., the specific solver's implementation, the problem structure, etc.). However, for many practical instances, commercial solvers can find optimal solutions quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Putting it together, setting up the LP has a time complexity of \\(O(m \\times n)\\). The solver's time complexity can vary, but the setup itself is polynomial in the size of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This provides a comprehensive view of the time complexity of your LP approach."

    "## Next Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "```markdown\n",
    "### Step 8: Test Current Algorithm\n",
    "1. Test with various data, particularly edge cases.\n",
    "2. Cases where all orders can't be satisfied.\n",
    "3. Cases where there's exact stock to meet demands.\n",
    "4. Situations with highly varied transportation times.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 9: Alternative Algorithms\n",
    "1. **Bipartite Graph Matching**: This can be seen as a variant of the assignment problem, where you're trying to assign warehouses to orders such that the cost (or time, in this context) is minimized.\n",
    "    - Implement using the Hungarian method or augmenting path algorithms.\n",
    "2. **Network Flow**: Model it as a min-cost max-flow problem. Each order and warehouse can be seen as nodes, with capacities and costs.\n",
    "3. **Non-Heuristic Optimization**: Explore solutions using optimization libraries like `scipy.optimize` or tools like Google's OR-tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 10: LP Data Generation for Testing\n",
    "1. Create a function to generate random scenarios that adhere to the problem's constraints.\n",
    "2. Make sure to include variations like:\n",
    "    - Varying the number of orders and warehouses.\n",
    "    - Introducing outliers in transportation times to test robustness.\n",
    "    - Having excess demand or stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 11: Comparative Analysis\n",
    "1. Compare the results of the various algorithms on the same test dataset.\n",
    "2. Analyze:\n",
    "    - Average minimized maximum transport time.\n",
    "    - Computation time.\n",
    "    - Scalability with increasing orders or warehouses.\n",
    "3. This will give insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, helping you choose the most suitable one.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 12: Documentation\n",
    "1. Document the assumptions made for each approach.\n",
    "2. Discuss the pros and cons of each method and provide guidelines on when to use which.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 13: Optimization\n",
    "1. Based on test results, try to further optimize the best-performing algorithms.\n",
    "2. Explore parallel processing or other optimization techniques to reduce computation time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 14: Final Testing & Validation\n",
    "1. Validate the final chosen solution on a broader test dataset.\n",
    "2. Ensure that all constraints are always met.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 15: Deployment\n",
    "1. If you're planning to integrate this solution into a larger system or tool, work on deployment.\n",
    "2. Ensure integration with other parts of your system, like databases or frontend interfaces, if applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember, while testing different algorithms, always use the same set of test data. This ensures a fair comparison between them.\n",
    "\n",
