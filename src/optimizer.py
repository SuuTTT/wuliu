def logistics_distribution(A1, A2, A3, W1, W2):
    """
    This function takes in five matrices A1, A2, A3, W1, W2 which represent 
    different aspects of a logistics problem. The function should output a 
    distribution plan to maximize overall satisfaction and minimize maximum 
    transportation time.
    
    Input:
    A1: A 3D numpy array of shape (m, n, k) representing the unit transportation time
    A2: A 2D numpy array of shape (m, k) representing the demand for each type of good for each order
    A3: A 2D numpy array of shape (n, k) representing the stock of each type of good in each warehouse
    W1: A 1D numpy array of length m representing the priority of each order
    W2: A 1D numpy array of length n representing the priority of each warehouse
    
    Output:
    A distribution plan that maximizes overall satisfaction and minimizes maximum transportation time.
