    "## background\n",
    "- **Problem Context**: The project's goal is to develop a product allocation algorithm. specifically, allocating one type of product from multiple warehouses to multiple orders.  The input to this algorithm consists of the transport time matrix X between warehouses and orders (per unit), an array Y specifying the demand of each order, and an array Z detailing the current stock of the product in each warehouse. The output should be a matrix A indicating the volume of product transported from each warehouse to each order, and the minimize the maximum transportation time, i.e. elements in  Hadamard product fo A and X.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Known Constraints**: Sum of allocations for each order≥Demand, Sum of allocations for each warehouse≤Inventory; the objective is to minimize the maximum transportation time across all warehouse-order allocation pairs.\n",
    "- **Technical Environment**: operate within a modified Jupyter Notebook environment.Python Version: 3.8\n",

    "### Convert JSON Data to Numpy Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "The function `json_to_matrices` converts the input JSON data into a set of NumPy arrays that represent different variables in a logistics distribution problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "- `A1`: 3D array representing unit transportation times. Dimensions: `(number of orders, number of warehouses, number of goods)`.\n",
    "- `A2`: 2D array representing demand for each type of good for each order. Dimensions: `(number of orders, number of goods)`.\n",
    "- `A3`: 2D array representing the stock of each type of good in each warehouse. Dimensions: `(number of warehouses, number of goods)`.\n",
    "- `W1`: 1D array representing the priority of each order.\n",
    "- `W2`: 1D array representing the priority of each warehouse.\n",
    "- `order_list`: List of all orders in the JSON data.\n",
    "- `warehouse_list`: List of all unique warehouse names in the JSON data.\n",
    "- `goods_list`: List of all unique goods in the JSON data.\n",
    "- `goods_dict`: Dictionary mapping each good to its unit size.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Workflow:\n",
    "1. Parses the number of orders (`m`), number of unique goods (`k`), and number of unique warehouses (`n`).\n",
    "2. Initializes matrices `A1`, `A2`, `A3` and arrays `W1`, `W2`.\n",
    "3. Populates these matrices and arrays based on the JSON data.\n",

    "1. Read the JSON data from a file, which contains all the necessary information like unit transportation times, demand for each type of good for each order, stock in each warehouse, priorities, etc.\n",
    "2. Convert this JSON data into matrices and arrays using the utility function `json_to_matrices`.\n",
    "3. Print these matrices for verification.\n",
    "4. Run the `logistics_distribution` algorithm with the parsed data.\n",
    "5. Print and save the result as a JSON file in the `test` directory.\n",

    "#### Additional Notes:\n",
    "- This function uses the `numpy` library for array manipulations.\n",
    "- It uses `json` library to handle JSON data.\n",
    "- It relies on a utility function `json_to_matrices` to convert JSON data into numpy arrays.\n",
    "- It saves the result in the 'test/result.json' file for future reference. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run this function to test the `logistics_distribution` algorithm using data from `data.json`. Make sure that the utility function `json_to_matrices` and the `logistics_distribution` function are properly imported from their respective modules."
